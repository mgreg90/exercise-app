## Introduction

The purpose of this simple workout app is for me to learn and familiarize myself
with the tech stack that I'll be using at my new job. Eventually I may build it
out to be something more complete.  I'm trying to learn C#/.Net, NUnit,
Knockout.js, and MongoDB.

## Client

Run `npm run start` to run the client application.

## Server

Run `dotnet run` to run the server.

## MongoDB

Run (in background) with `brew services start mongodb-community`.

Kill with `brew services stop mongodb-community`.
